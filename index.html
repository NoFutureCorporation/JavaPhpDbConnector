<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

					Here you will find explained everything about the connector. 
					It is really easy to use and is fully prepared to work with the MVC pattern. 
					Java-Php Database Connector has been designed to connect to the database via PHP and PDO library's. 
					This idea was born when we were working on an Android project and we needed to connect to an external database on our server.
					To solve the problem, we decided to develop this connector to have full control of the database.
					Java-Php Database Connector allows you to run any SQL statement against the database (DDL , DML ... ) .

						class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Especially for Android
				</h3>

				<p> We designed this connector especially for Android but can be used in any Java application.
				In Android OS it is not recommended to use the JDBC connector and must make connections with the database via HTTP or HTTPS.
				Java-Php Database Connector solves this problem because it makes all connections over HTTPS ( Force to use this protocol, but can be disabled at the user, but is not recommended).

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
